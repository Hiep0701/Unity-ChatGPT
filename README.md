Right mouse click to move and press Enter to open chatbox.

## Features
- Teachable AI: You can easily teach the AI new things by providing it with examples of how to respond to certain inputs, or you can define how to answer the player.
- Local data storage: Your conversations with the AI are stored locally (in ScriptableObject).
- Multiple characters: Helps you set up multiple ways to answer the player. Each NPC has another way to answer questions.
- Multiple models: Currently supports GPT3.5 Turbo and GPT4 models.
- Memorization: The AI can remember what was said before.
- Streamable: Answers from the AI can be received and shown as soon as possible. You don't need to wait until the response is complete to receive it.
- Modifiable answers: You can set the maximum response length and randomize it.
- Detection around: You can set up when a player is near an NPC with an AI setting, the player can ask them and receive an answer.
- Extensible: I write the code using some design pattern for extension in the future. Maybe I will let this become a full-featured chatbot for games.
- Bark: Players and NPCs show chat content above their heads.
- Scrollable GUI: The GUI is scrollable.
