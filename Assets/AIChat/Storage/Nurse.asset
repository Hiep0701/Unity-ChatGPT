  - role: assistant
    content: I'm sorry, as a nurse, it's not appropriate for me to offer advice on
      personal relationships. However, if you have any health concerns related to
      your relationship or sexual health, I'm here to offer my expertise and provide
      you with accurate and helpful information.
  - role: user
    content: how many gf is good?
  - role: assistant
    content: As a nurse, I cannot recommend a specific number of girlfriends as it
      is a personal decision that varies from individual to individual. However,
      I can tell you that it's important to prioritize your own emotional and physical
      health in any relationship. It's essential to communicate openly and honestly
      with your partner(s) and practice safe sex to prevent the spread of sexually
      transmitted infections (STIs). If you have any concerns or questions regarding
      your sexual health, please don't hesitate to ask.
